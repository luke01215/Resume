These programs provide an overview of stan...,,"programs specifically in network or computer engineering. These programs provide an overview of standard industry networking tools and procedures for resolving problems within computer networks. Classes cover topics like operating systems, programming essentials, network administration, and information security. Students may also gain instruction in specific networking systems, like Cisco.
Success Tip:
To get the most out of your degree, complete an internship. Experience is essential to entering this career, and so aspiring computer network engineers may benefit from completing internships to gain practical experience in the industry. In fact, some bachelor's programs offer internships to network engineering students. Some individuals may find that their schools instead offer cooperative learning experiences, which similarly allow the opportunity to gain hands-on experience while earning college credit.
Step 2: Work as a Network Administrator
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that many network engineers are promoted from network administration or other similar IT positions. Network administrators mostly focus on installing, maintaining, and monitoring the performance of networks, as well as overseeing IT support specialists, and they may assist engineers in the network design process. After earning at least five years of experience and demonstrating proficiency in networking, these workers may advance to network engineer status.
Success Tip:
You can also choose to earn industry-standard certifications. Software vendors such as Microsoft, Cisco, and Red Hat offer certifications to network administrators who use their products after passage of an exam. Possessing one of these certifications may enable individuals to advance in their careers faster, and some employers even require administrators to be certified in specific programs.
Step 3: Consider Earning a Graduate Degree
The BLS notes that some employers favor network engineers who possess graduate degrees, such as an MBA with a focus on information systems. These MBA programs typically last 2 years and combine instruction in business topics with instruction in IT concepts. Master of Science in Computer Networking degree programs are also available. These programs include classes in wireless networking, telecommunications design, and Internet protocols.

You will be installing servers, workstations, cabling, mounts, backup systems, digital imaging software packages, and the other items necessary for our clients to effectively utilize technology in their business. You will also be responsible for providing field and remote support as needed, working in cooperation with our operations center. You don’t report to an office each day, you work from home for support and go directly to client sites for onsite service. If you enjoy working in different offices and changes in scenery, this is a great opportunity.
About the Company: Advantage Technologies (www.adv-tech.com) is pretty much one of the coolest places to work in the world. We treat our people like partners, and everyone pulls together to build our team. No gossip, no backstabbing. We really care about our people, and it shows. Advantage Technologies provides computer hardware, software, security, and networking infrastructure to small business, particularly focusing on professional service organizations (dentists, doctors, engineering companies, insurance agencies, CPA firms, etc). We provide the servers, workstations, cabling, management and integration services to keep our clients serving their clients. We deliver Hassle Free IT.

Key Responsibilities: The Network Engineer works on the regional team serving clients, and plays a critical role. This position is divided into the following key responsibility areas:
1. Customer Technical Support – providing remote and onsite support to our existing client base in cooperation with the operations and support center. Assist our operations center with coordinating who on your team to send where as needed.
2. Project implementation – once a customer purchases a system, you need to manage the implementation of the project. You need to be technically comfortable with managing server installations, workstation deployments, installation of software and network systems. Additionally, you need to be mechanically inclined. We hang mounts, TV’s, run cabling, install xray machines, and a variety of other mechanical tasks that aren’t considered “classic IT”. If you’re looking to sit in a server room and push buttons, this isn’t for you. If you’re looking to integrate IT into a business and make it look awesome – you could be a fit.
3. Assisting the sales team – Everyone on our team helps the sales team by being “on the lookout” for new sales opportunities. Maybe you’re in an office that has hardware that should be refreshed. Maybe you’re onsite at an office that is currently not managed. These are opportunities to make the sales rep in the area aware of, so that they can pursue these clients.
4. Be accountable with your time – all time and activities should be clearly logged in our CRM system.
Desired Skills and Experience:
Understanding of Windows based networks including servers, workstations, and core networking concepts
Understanding of routers, switches, firewalls, and other basic networking equipment, specifically related to installation and troubleshooting.
Understanding of printers, scanners, and other standard IT peripherals, specifically related to installation and troubleshooting.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills
Ability to maintain professionalism in challenging situations
Excellent organizational skills
Ability to work in a fast-paced environment independently and meet aggressive deadlines
Ability to work independently, self-starter
Ability to work with technical teams and internal teams to ensure client success
Experience with Microsoft Office
Experience with ConnectWise and/or LabTech
Compensation Plan: The position is salary plus benefits, profit sharing, retirement plan, and an expense account. The salary is evaluated each year at your annual review, and there are great growth opportunities with our team. Compensation includes:
Salary reflective of experience, skillset, and value brought to the organization
Great growth opportunities based on performance
Paid holidays and personal time off
Monthly vehicle allowance
Monthly cell phone allowance
Travel expense account including meals, gas, and other travel expenses as needed
Medical, Dental, and Vision Coverage Available
Company paid short term and long term disability insurance
Company paid IRA plan with company contribution match
Profit sharing on a monthly basis per company guidelines and an annual bonus plan
Corporate card for approved expenses including travel
Advancement Opportunity: The Network Engineer is great opening opportunity in the engineering team. The next position would be a Senior Engineer. As the customer base grows, we make it a policy to promote from within, given that individuals have demonstrated the ability to handle that level of leadership.
Employee Supplied Items: You will be responsible for supplying the following:
Portable computer running Windows 7 or newer, with an i5 or faster processor, 8gb of RAM with a docking solution that allows for dual monitors when working from home, and sufficient battery lift for working at client offices.
Android, iPhone, or Windows phone with adequate voice and data allowances.
High speed internet connection at your home office.
A quiet, distraction free home office.
Probationary Period: The first 90 days of employment is considered to be probationary and a training period. The probationary period will be considered complete (possibly ahead of 90 days), if the individual can demonstrate satisfactory results in the key responsibility areas listed above.

WHAT DO NETWORK ENGINEERS DO?
Also known as computer network architects, network engineers work with a company's computer network, using information technology to make network systems for all employees to use. These data networks can include local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), intranets and extranets. Network complexity can vary depending on the organization, and the company may have one dedicated engineer or many globally connected engineers working together with the Chief Technology Officer.
Network engineers must have skills to analyze where communications are going to be needed, create plans for the network, present it to senior management, be up-to-date on the latest technology, understand and determine the hardware and wiring needs for buildings, and make sure Mike in Accounting doesn't accidentally forward his Star Wars fan fiction to all staff.
HOW MUCH DO NETWORK ENGINEERS MAKE?
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) a Robert Half Technology survey estimated that network architects made between $85,000 and $117,750 a year.
WHAT ARE THE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS?
You must at least have a bachelor's degree in a computer related field, such as programming, computer science, engineering or similar, and many employers prefer applicants to have an MBA in information systems. Employers also look for experience in the field, either working with IT systems or in network administration.
JOB SKILLS AND REQUIREMENTS
Analytical Skills: Network engineers have to look at complicated network systems to find flaws or room for improvement.
Attention to Detail: Network engineers have to create complex blueprints for communication networks, and must make sure the systems will work together.
Leadership Skills: Network engineers may be a leader of other engineers to create the network.
Organizational Skills: Sometimes many different networks come together at once. Keeping them all organized will take skill.
Teamwork: Larger firms have many employees and many engineers working together.
THE FUTURE OF NETWORK ENGINEERS
According to the BLS, network engineer jobs will decline between 2010 and 2020, as the rise in cloud computing will create less demand for in-house networks.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Heres how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think were old (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but were also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do you cant put us in a box!
But Digital Transformation is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Dont care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? Thats cool.

Project Title: Pipol Konek
Project Description
The Philippines is recognized as a high user of online services: an estimated 67 Million Filipinos use Facebook. Yet 59% of the population and 72% of all households’ lack access to the internet. Despite passage of the Free Internet in Public Places Act (2017) that mandates the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to provide internet access free at the point of service, progress to expand the number connected has been slow, with less than 10% of an initial target total of 13,024 sites (increasing to 200,000 sites by 2026) reached since June 2016. Difficulties in bidding processes and implementation challenges have slowed progress and limited access to cost-effective and up-to-date technology options.
The proposed project will support DICT’s commitment to accelerate the roll-out of the Pipol Konek program which is designed to provide free wi-fi internet access in public places. Working in partnership with DICT, UNDP will bid out managed services contracts for designated areas that currently have no or limited access to internet in public places, including educational institutions, local government buildings, public parks and plazas and other public buildings and facilities. This phase of the DICT-UNDP partnership aims to expand internet access in more than 6,000 additional sites in 66 provinces.
The project will contribute to closing the digital divide in the Philippines by providing incentives to encourage new and existing service providers to expand internet coverage in designated areas. The project will incorporate third-party monitoring mechanisms to ensure internet service providers meet service quality standards. The project will also include resources to develop the capacity of DICT staff to oversee the procurement, management and implementation of future largescale ICT investments.

Network engineers are intrigued by computer network design and implementation. They find innovative solutions to difficult technical problems. Network engineers are responsible for the protection and safety of computers and operating systems in government offices, schools, corporations and businesses of all types and sizes.
Skillset: Good computer skills are important in the network engineering field. Other useful skills include analytical thinking, problem solving, strong communication and an exceptionally detailed attention span. It is also important to work well within a team.
Education: To become a network engineer you will need to obtain training and certification through a reputable organization. General certification programs will help you to get your foot in the door but will limit your earning potential. Experience in networking or instructional training in computer systems is important. Participation in vendor-authorized education courses may be required. Training should cover network security, switching and routing, network media, devices, and types, troubleshooting, network operation and installation of software.
Career Path: Some lower-level employment opportunities in network engineering are available with a certificate or associate's degree. However, the majority of the higher paying positions require a bachelor's degree in information technology or computer science. Because you will be required to regularly test, maintain and monitor the tools and software related to computer networks you will need to seek continuing education programs as much and as often as possible. As you gain useful experience in trouble shooting, network security and information delivery you will be well equipped to move into higher paying positions.

As a Network Engineer, your work would include providing regular scheduled proactive visits to your assigned clients in the Washington DC metropolitan area. You would ensure the smooth operation of the client environment, address any client issues, and handle issues that have been escalated from our support center, becoming a trusted IT advisor to your client. You will also be a part of project teams for your clients and others, designing and implementing solutions that enable our clients to meet their business objectives.
Although you will primarily work within Microsoft systems (Windows Server, Microsoft Exchange, Windows 10, Office 365) you will also support other technologies, such as Macs and 3rd-party software (Quickbooks, document management systems, Dropbbox, etc.). You should be well versed in layer 2 and layer 3 network switches, routers, and firewalls.
Our engineers maintain regular schedules, visiting each client once a week or twice a month on either a half-day or a full-day basis. Although you are the primary technical expert for the client’s network, you are not the only support. In between visits, our clients are also supported by our client services team and our support center.
In this role you will report to an engineering team lead (along with other network engineers and deskside support specialists) but operate with minimal supervision. When you are faced with a new challenge, you will be able to rely on the expertise of your colleagues for technical advice and support. Engineers at Optimal often work together on projects to leverage individual expertise and to learn new skills (from design and build of new servers or systems to deploying new networks for office moves).
Our Philosophy
For the past 28 years, Optimal Networks has been building a culture that even Forbes thinks is a little…unconventional. With over a decade’s worth of Workplace Excellence Awards under our belt, and a top ethics award to boot, we take our people and our environment to heart.
It boils down to this: a team that is happy and engaged is going to provide its clients with the absolute highest level of service. We’re about helping people in the best possible way and delivering the kind of support that our competitors wish they could match.
And, thanks to our client services team, sales team, and remote helpdesk team, that’s exactly what you’ll be able to focus on as an Optimal Networks Engineer; you’ll take ownership of your clients’ technology systems, deliver white-glove support, and not have to worry about the administrative pieces of the puzzle.
Your Position
You will join an elite team of engineers who are serving our nearly 100 clients in the DC Metro area and beyond. You’ll serve as the primary liaison to a dedicated subset of our clients and will help them solve business problems with your expert technology guidance.
No two clients are alike, which means you’ll have your hands in different environments, different technologies, and different atmospheres on a day-to-day basis.
You’ll have our full suite of managed and cloud services (and the rest of our team) at your disposal, and the freedom to advise your clients as you see fit. As our technologies and your clients’ technologies continue advance, so too will your own skills.
Your Responsibilities
Quickly and accurately identifying client needs and seeing the appropriate solution through from design to completion.
Serving as an expert resource to our clients, and to our internal staff for various tasks and projects.
Mastering a wide range of network environments and continuing to expand your skillset as the technology landscape evolves.
Your Qualifications
BS/BA degree and 5 or more years of relevant experience.
Proven customer service and problem solving skills. Excellent at communicating in a way that makes sense to non-technical people (face-to-face and written).
Deep understanding of Microsoft Windows Server products 2012 R2 and 2016, Exchange 2010 and 2016, Office 365, backup systems, email systems, virus protection, desktop operating systems, contact management, and similar technologies critical to business operations.
Detailed theoretical and practical knowledge of IP protocols, firewalls, and routers.
Experience configuring, installing, and troubleshooting routers, hubs, and switches.
Experience with VMWare, SonicWALL, or Citrix.
Must be willing to travel around the Washington DC area on a regular basis.
What We Offer
Our benefits include medical, dental, vision, and life insurance, transit parking, PTO, a laptop, and tuition reimbursement.
We’ll provide certification and training opportunities, including certification testing reimbursement.
We’ll trust you to be on the front lines of our company’s service delivery, and your time will be valued.
You’ll join a corporate culture that gets you events like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPakytp-Ako&feature=youtu.be

Project Title: Pipol Konek
Project Description
The Philippines is recognized as a high user of online services: an estimated 67 Million Filipinos use Facebook. Yet 59% of the population and 72% of all households’ lack access to the internet. Despite passage of the Free Internet in Public Places Act (2017) that mandates the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to provide internet access free at the point of service, progress to expand the number connected has been slow, with less than 10% of an initial target total of 13,024 sites (increasing to 200,000 sites by 2026) reached since June 2016. Difficulties in bidding processes and implementation challenges have slowed progress and limited access to cost-effective and up-to-date technology options.
The proposed project will support DICT’s commitment to accelerate the roll-out of the Pipol Konek program which is designed to provide free wi-fi internet access in public places. Working in partnership with DICT, UNDP will bid out managed services contracts for designated areas that currently have no or limited access to internet in public places, including educational institutions, local government buildings, public parks and plazas and other public buildings and facilities. This phase of the DICT-UNDP partnership aims to expand internet access in more than 6,000 additional sites in 66 provinces.
The project will contribute to closing the digital divide in the Philippines by providing incentives to encourage new and existing service providers to expand internet coverage in designated areas. The project will incorporate third-party monitoring mechanisms to ensure internet service providers meet service quality standards. The project will also include resources to develop the capacity of DICT staff to oversee the procurement, management and implementation of future largescale ICT investments.
An initial set of bidding documents has been prepared but they require review and revision to ensure they are fully fit-for-purpose in terms of enable maximum market participation from local and international players and encourage the use of the most appropriate and cost-effective technology solutions.

Difficulties in bidding processes and implementation challenges have slowed progress and limited access to cost-effective and up-to-date technology options.
The proposed project will support DICT’s commitment to accelerate the roll-out of the Pipol Konek program which is designed to provide free wi-fi internet access in public places. Working in partnership with DICT, UNDP will bid out managed services contracts for designated areas that currently have no or limited access to internet in public places, including educational institutions, local government buildings, public parks and plazas and other public buildings and facilities. This phase of the DICT-UNDP partnership aims to expand internet access in more than 6,000 additional sites in 66 provinces.
The project will contribute to closing the digital divide in the Philippines by providing incentives to encourage new and existing service providers to expand internet coverage in designated areas. The project will incorporate third-party monitoring mechanisms to ensure internet service providers meet service quality standards. The project will also include resources to develop the capacity of DICT staff to oversee the procurement, management and implementation of future largescale ICT investments.
