About ThousandEyes
The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a ""black box"" outside of their control. ThousandEyes gives organizations visibility and insight into the now borderless network. It arms them with an accurate understanding of how the network impacts their applications, users and customers. ThousandEyes is used by some of the world's largest and fastest growing brands, including 4 of the top 5 SaaS companies, 4 of the top 5 US banks and 3 of the Fortune 5. ThousandEyes is backed by Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, Tenaya Capital and Sutter Hill Ventures, with headquarters in San Francisco, CA.
Engineering at ThousandEyes
At ThousandEyes, we use cutting-edge technologies and innovative techniques to study and visualize networks on a global scale. ThousandEyes engineers are focused on continuous improvement — of our product, our codebase, our knowledge, and our skills. We believe in innovation, simplicity, and elegance. We work in small, cross-functional teams where everyone has a voice.

Life at United States Digital Service
About United States Digital Service
USDS is a group of technologists from diverse backgrounds working across the federal government to transform critical services for all Americans. Interacting with the government should be as easy as buying a book online. We prioritize projects to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the greatest need.
We offer experienced technologists the opportunity to serve tours of service (six months to four years), empowering them to bring fresh perspectives and skills to the highest levels of government. We employ modern software development best practices and user-centered design to improve the way government serves millions of people.
""Veterans still need easy access to their benefits online, taxes need to be secure, student loans need to be easy to repay and immigration forms need to get digitized."" - Matt Cutts, USDS Administrator, He/Him
""I was inspired to join the U.S. Digital Service because I wanted to serve the country, and I saw an opportunity to use my technology skillsets and experiences for leveraged impact."" - Tracy Chou, She/Her
""It’s not about how can we maximize digital ad space or make conversion rates better, but how we can use technology to really make a difference in someone’s life."" - David Holmes, Director of Engineering, He/Him
""Improving the aging technology that government and its services run on was an extremely compelling goal."" - Eileen Chen, She/Her
""Government systems and processes are, as we say, a “target-rich environment” where even small changes can make big improvements. Those improvements make it possible for government agencies to serve the public better, which is extremely rewarding."" - David Methvin, He/Him
""I started at USDS in late 2014. I decided to join after sitting on the floor of the Grace Hopper Women in Computing Conference with Mikey Dickerson, then the administrator of USDS, who pitched this idea of a new tech startup inside government at the White House...I think it’s critical to have technologists in the federal government because we have government services that require consumer-facing products, and we need people in-house who know how to build them."" - Kathy Pham, She/Her
""The first thing I worked on was helping to launch a digitized version of the form that allows veterans to apply for healthcare benefits, Department of Veterans Affairs Form 10-10EZ. We were building a mobile-first responsive application that was replacing a hosted PDF that only worked in Internet Explorer 8 and below and Adobe Acrobat 7.5 and below. Less than 10 percent of veterans could submit the previous version of the 10-10EZ form. By making a modern, mobile-first, responsive online application we saw an increase of almost 10x the submissions within the first three months"". - Robbie Holmes, He/Him
""I was really excited this summer to have an opportunity to contribute to a lot of projects - grid modeling at the Department of Energy, better hiring at the Office of Personnel Management, better access to health data for Medicare providers at Health and Human Services, faster software for the Marines"". - Annie Sullivan, She/Her
THE USDS ORIGIN STORY
It all started with Healthcare.gov. The site launched in October 2013 and immediately encountered massive technical challenges. The Administration moved fast to recruit high-caliber engineers from the private sector to fix the website. They worked around the clock and quickly fixed the Healthcare.gov’s reliability issues. Over 8 million Americans had successfully signed up for health insurance by the end of the first open enrollment period.
Members of the Healthcare.gov rescue team went on to found the United States Digital Service to fulfill the non-partisan mission of building better government services through design and technology.
USDS deploys small, responsive groups of designers, engineers, product managers, and bureaucracy hackers to partner with and empower civil service colleagues. These multi-disciplinary teams bring best practices and new approaches to support government modernization efforts.
Our products engage real users before launch. We apply user-centered design and iterative development to prioritize user needs and learn what works as quickly as possible.
We don’t look like your typical government employees (hoodies and sneakers reign supreme here) and we’ve been known to attend Star Wars premieres en masse. We can see the impact our work makes on real people’s lives. In the five years since our inception, we have helped the government avoid spending more than $1 billion in taxpayer dollars.
Our leadership team is comprised of 50% women, and our staff is more than 40% female overall. We recruit technologists from all different backgrounds and communities across the country, not just Silicon Valley. Diversity is important to us because we build better products when our team represents all of America.

Dell Servers and EqualLogic storage
Fortinet and Cisco Routers, ASAs, and Switches, HSRP / Keepalived / BGP
IIS, DFS, Multi-site AD, SQL Server 2017
Future: Containers and Kubernetes for both on-prem and cloud infrastructure
Some projects that we've recently completed or are working on:
Improving infrastructure automation around our WIndows and Linux servers
Implementing autonomous OS upgrades for both Windows and Linux servers
Upgrading hardware with zero downtime across a variety of services
Migrating to a new CDN

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is an engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Google's services—both our internally critical and our externally-visible systems—have reliability and uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of improvement while keeping an ever-watchful eye on capacity and performance.
SRE is also a mindset and a set of engineering approaches to running better production systems—we build our own creative engineering solutions to operations problems. Much of our software development focuses on optimizing existing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. As SREs are responsible for the big picture of how our systems relate to each other, we use a breadth of tools and approaches to solve a broad spectrum of problems. Practices such as limiting time spent on operational work, blameless postmortems and proactive identification of potential outages factor into iterative improvement that is key to both product quality and interesting and dynamic day-to-day work.
SRE's culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity, problem solving and openness is key to its success. Our organization brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame-free environment.

Job Description
Stack Overflow is growing fast, and our infrastructure needs just keep getting bigger. We’re looking for a senior sysadmin to join our team of extraordinary sysadmins and developers working on sites that see 4000-6000 hits per second during peak times.
In addition to having a passion for working with software and keeping a top 50 website on the web, you should love hardware. We love pushing hardware as hard as we possibly can. This means hands-on maintenance from time to time. We require our SREs to be good coders. We are a mixed Windows and Linux shop; you should be highly proficient in one and comfortable with the other.
At Stack Overflow we’re passionate about our technology. We own and operate our own infrastructure, and take the time to do it right. We like to stay on the cutting edge of technology, so you will always be working with or working towards using the latest and greatest there is. We get all the hardware we need for redundancy and performance.
Because we take the time to do things right, our on call responsibilities are very light. We get paged very infrequently.
Some projects that we've recently completed or are working on:
Improving how we monitor service internals
Automating firmware upgrades
Improving HBase reliability
Migrating to a new CDN
Evaluating new security and VPN technologies
Hardware upgrades for all our Microsoft SQL Servers with 0 downtime
We're involved in Microsoft TAP programs (early access)
Technologies you’ll work with:
Windows 2012 R2 and 2016
Modern Linux distributions - we’re running CentOS 7
Haproxy, Redis, Puppet, Elasticsearch
IIS, DFS, Multi-site AD, SQL Server 2016
Fortinet Firewalls, Cisco Routers, Switches, HSRP / Keepalived / BGP
PowerShell, C#, Go, Bash, Python
What you’ll do:
Maintain the services and infrastructure platform used by the Stack Overflow websites
Help us handle traffic of 4000 hits/sec and plan for growth to 10,000
Take on big projects from inception to deployment
Handle alerts on all parts of our infrastructure as part of a 24x7 on-call rotation (approximately 1 week out of 5)
Be awesome and teach others to do the same by blogging about it
What you’ll need to have:
Expertise in either Windows or Linux environments (and exposure to both)
Knowledge of programming beyond scripting (we use Golang, C#, and others)
Experience working hands-on with Server class hardware (we are a Dell shop)
Basic understanding of networking: the HTTP protocol, how load balancers work, IP addressing
(We use HAProxy, Fast.ly/Varnish, Keepalived, IIS)
Experience with a configuration management system (we use Puppet)
A track record of taking on challenges and delivering thorough, stable, and maintainable systems
Non-Technical skills we expect:
A track record of getting projects done in a timely manner
Works well in a team
Document as you go, not at the end of a project
Not required, but would be considered a plus:
You live near our Denver or Jersey City datacenters
You have experience with HBase system administration
A security-oriented mindset
Experience in a SOX or PCI environment
Experience with Azure
Added bonus if you have a public history of accomplishments in the field: public speaking, blogging, awards, or contributions to open source projects
Diverse teams build better products
Legally, we need you to know this: Stack Exchange, Inc. does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class. We support workplace diversity.
But we want to add this: We strongly believe that diversity of experience contributes to a broader collective perspective that will consistently lead to a better company and better products. We are working hard to increase the diversity of our team wherever we can and we actively encourage everyone to consider becoming a part of it.

Come join the SRE team at Stack Overflow! As one of the top 50 websites by traffic volume worldwide, we hit some unique challenges. Recently we’ve launched Stack Overflow for Enterprise and Stack Overflow for Teams, allowing organizations to have a private experience on the platform they already know and love. The success of these new products requires us to rethink our infrastructure strategy for supporting on-prem, cloud, and remote deployments.
We’re looking for someone with Linux administration experience (3+ years), and experience with containerization and managing cloud resources is a plus. You’ll join our team of SREs and devs and continue driving and improving our systems automation efforts and managing Linux and container based services. We don’t expect you to know everything about all of the technologies we use, so you’ll work with other members of the team to learn and develop your skills.
As an SRE, you’ll bring a developer mindset to system administration, always looking for ways to automate manual work and create repeatable, scalable systems and processes. We are wiki-centric and prefer to document and automate in small increments as we work.

Why we think this job is worth applying for!
Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a remote-first organization with a growing team from 15+ European countries. Every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.
“It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission” (Grace Hopper) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which, is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things like in the guidebook. You can try things out! Our default to 100% transparency will help you here.
We play a key role in our customers' digital transformation. We have partnered up with Amazon and Microsoft to provide our solution on their cloud platforms - more will follow.
We have been in this ecosystem from the get-go and as part of the CNCF family, we feel at home in the community. As a part of Giant Swarm, you will also join this extended family.
We serve some of Europe's leading organizations and are talking to many more.
What’s the most challenging part of your job?""Finding time to concentrate on a specific task (especially if it's in-depth) - SREs context-switch a lot""

Job description
Our infrastructure is a combination of vastly distributed systems, high-performance computing and low-latency trading algorithms on one hand, and high-throughput dataflows, huge storage and data analysis on the other. We evolve our systems on a daily basis. The challenge: balancing innovation speed with reliability and performance.
Site reliability engineering at Optiver
Our Site Reliability Engineers focus on prevention and swift resolution of operational issues, guarding the reliability and performance of our systems. Reliability to us means having full control over our systems and guaranteeing proper functioning even in the most extreme market conditions.
In contrast to traditional site reliability engineering, when faced with unforeseen circumstances (edge-cases), we typically choose to stop our systems rather than find ways to guarantee up-time. Typically manual intervention is the safer option in such situations, rather than automated failovers and/or restarts.
Simplicity and deterministic behaviour are important aspects of reliability to us.
Day-to-day
No two days are the same, but overall our engineers maintain, monitor and improve the reliability, scalability and performance of our in-house built trading software. Sitting in the middle of the trading floor, we closely collaborate with the Traders, Researchers and fellow Engineers. We evolve our tooling that helps us monitor the health of our systems and address issues as they arise.
With our operational mindset, we look for the best ways to implement new ideas and help the functional engineering teams in the process of building trading software, to fit relevant operational considerations.
The ratio between development and hands-on support work is about 50-50; automating mundane and repetitive tasks is part of day-to-day work.
What you need to be successful
You are a pragmatic, logical thinker. With a facilitating and enabling attitude as well as hands-on mentality, you always search for the simplest solutions. You are naturally curious about hardware and software, and how these interact. You are able to explain your thoughts clearly through written and verbal communication, ask the right questions, and are not afraid to challenge your colleagues. You look for opportunities to get out of your comfort zone and like frequent change.
In terms of skillset
Experience managing day-to-day operations of software and hardware infrastructure;
Strong affinity with Unix/Linux systems;
The ability to automate tasks using Python;
Experience with relational databases (e.g. MSSQL, postgres);
An understanding of networking fundamentals and protocols.
What you can expect from us
We understand that our best work is done together. We constantly ask ourselves how to do better, which creates a stimulating and fun environment, where you are seriously rewarded for your performance. To be concrete, we offer excellent remuneration and great secondary benefits, such as an attractive profit sharing structure, training opportunities, fully paid first-class commuting expenses, a premium-free pension, breakfast and lunch facilities, sports and leisure activities, even weekly chair massages and of course Friday afternoon drinks. We are used to guiding expats through their relocation and offer relocation packages and discounts on health insurance.
Interested?
The first step after applying for this job is an online (HackerRank) test assessing your problem solving and programming skills (in Python). No prior trading knowledge needed.
Kindly note that we do not require any assistance from third-parties including agencies in the recruitment of this role.

Dell Servers and EqualLogic storage
Fortinet and Cisco Routers, ASAs, and Switches, HSRP / Keepalived / BGP
IIS, DFS, Multi-site AD, SQL Server 2017
Future: Containers and Kubernetes for both on-prem and cloud infrastructure
Some projects that we've recently completed or are working on:
Improving infrastructure automation around our WIndows and Linux servers
Implementing autonomous OS upgrades for both Windows and Linux servers

Experience with Microsoft SQLServer administration and query tuning
Experience with Dell OME (or other firmware management system)
Experience with network device administration
Experience with TeamCity, Jenkins, OctoDeploy, or other CI systems

Founded by an MD PhD, we understand that researchers want technology to work for them, not against them.
Our goal is to ensure the world’s research data becomes reusable and machine-readable so that we can leverage the power of AI to help us solve the biggest healthcare challenges. To be successful, we need to continuously improve and grow our product. We believe we can accomplish this with a healthy, happy, world-class team that is looking to make an impact.

Summary
The Wikimedia Foundation is hiring a Senior Site Reliability Engineer to support and maintain the data and statistics infrastructure that powers a big part of decision making in the Foundation and in the Wiki community. This includes everything from eliminating boring things from your daily workflow by automating them, to upgrading a multi-petabyte Hadoop cluster to the next upstream version without impacting uptime and users.
We're looking for an experienced candidate who's excited about working with big data systems. Ideally you will already have some experience working with software like Hadoop, Kafka, Spark and other members of the distributed computing world. Since you'll be joining an existing team of SREs you'll have plenty of space and opportunities to get familiar with our tech, so there's no need to immediately have the answer to every question.
We are a full-time distributed team with no one working out of the actual Wikimedia office, so we are all together in the same remote boat. Part of the team is in Europe and part in the United States. We see each other in person two or three times a year, either during one of our off-sites (most recently in Europe), the Wikimedia All Hands (once a year), or Wikimania, the annual international conference for the Wiki community.

Building a new and improved Jupyter notebooks ecosystem for the Foundation and the community to use
Upgrading the cluster to Hadoop 3
Skills and Experience:
2+ years experience in an SRE/Operations/DevOps role as part of a team
Experience in supporting complex web applications running highly available and high traffic infrastructure based on Linux
Comfortable with configuration management and orchestration tools (Puppet, Ansible, Chef, SaltStack, etc.), and modern observability infrastructure (monitoring, metrics and logging)
An appetite for the automation and streamlining of tasks
Willingness to work with JVM-based systems
Comfortable with shell and scripting languages used in an SRE/Operations engineering context (e.g. Python, Go, Bash, Ruby, etc.)
Good understanding of Linux/Unix fundamentals and debugging skills
Strong English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team
B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science, related field or equivalent in related work experience. Do not feel you need a degree to apply; we value hands-on experience most of all.

Hi there!
We are seeking a Senior Site Reliability Engineers in North America to join our team! As we continue to scale both our product and grow our team, we’re looking for experienced Site Reliability Engineers to help drive automation, performance and reliability in our cloud- based infrastructure. As part of this team, you’ll be responsible for the core elements of our AWS infrastructure and orchestration.
Using site reliability principles and a robust approach to observability, you will not only fix problems but solve the issues that contributed to them when things go wrong. You'll improve application reliability by using a software engineering approach to operations. You'll develop internal tools and systems for all engineering teams to leverage. You'll get to impact every engineering team in the organization and use a broad set of technologies. Maintaining excellent relationships and communicating effectively with teams will be key to success.
Building new features and services is a big part of this role. We are continually developing and implementing new ways to support our teams, understanding our customers needs, and becoming experts in site reliability.
When bad things happen, you'll have the support of your team to solve contributing causes, to learn from failures, and to build a robust and resilient system for our customers. We look for the solution that automates the problem away, not the one that requires manual effort.
If you’re interested in making a big impact and taking our infrastructure to the next level at a fast-growing and profitable startup, then read on.
We know applying for and taking on a new job at any company requires a leap of faith. We want you to feel comfortable and excited to apply at Zapier.

About You
You’re an experienced technologist. You have at least 7 years of experience in the world of systems administration, systems engineering, or software development with at least 3 years of experience in Site Reliability Engineering, DevOps, or related field.
You know the cloud. You’ve designed and maintained highly available, cloud based infrastructures in AWS or another cloud offering. You understand how to leverage infrastructure as code tools, and have experience implementing best practices for reliability and observability. We use tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Redis, Gitlab, and Datadog among others.
You can code. You have experience with a language like Python or Go to create automated tools. You believe in hands-off deployments and infrastructure as code. Well-honed experience with the fundamentals of software development goes a long way here.
You can solve complex systems challenges. You take ownership of complex challenges, understand how to improve performance, and help uncover opportunities for improvement. You’ve worked on problems where “just throw more hardware at it” isn’t enough for the system to scale.
You’re a great communicator. Not only do you know how to share your knowledge with the team and document things well so they can be consumed asynchronous (we do this a lot as a remote company), but you know how to communicate effectively with software and support teams.
You value our values. At Zapier, our values are at the heart of how we work together and how we think about our customers. In our remote setting, they help develop trust and ensure we work and collaborate together to democratize automation.

This role calls upon a broad range of experience and technologies. You'll get to interact with every engineering team in the organization. Maintaining excellent relationships and communicating effectively with those teams regularly is key to success.
Zapier is rapidly scaling and growing, and you will work directly on the applications that support over 5 million customers. When bad things happen, you'll have the support of your team to solve contributing causes, to learn from failures, and to build a robust and resilient system for our customers.

Just a little more than 2 years post-launch, we have hundreds of companies using our platform, just secured $25M in Series B funding, and are working with awesome strategic investors like Salesforce, Hubspot, Slack, and Okta. Best of all, we’re just getting started. In a market full of uncertainty, we are fortunate to have an unwavering long-term vision and the funding to see it through at full speed.
Crossbeam helps companies partner with each other in a more data-driven way by acting as an escrow service for data. Our platform allows companies to find overlapping customers and prospects with their partners while keeping the rest of their data private and secure.
With this big idea comes some fun and unique technical challenges: We’re like a social network for data warehouses, so the data gets big and our results need to show up fast; we need to reliably find “matches” between data sets originating from different systems; we need our users to love the experience and capture real value every step of the way; security and trust are paramount. And there’s more where that came from.
You’ll partner with our developers to ensure performance across our features. You will bring a mix of deep technical knowledge and operational business sense to deploy and scale systems in our fast-paced startup environment as the second SRE on the Engineering Team.
Responsibilities include:
Scaling & Growth. Take ownership of scaling our AWS EKS cluster, ELK stack, Postgres databases, Jenkins deployment, and more.
Improvement of Process Work closely with other engineers on identifying and addressing shortcomings in our infrastructure and in our deployment processes.
Monitoring and Alerting Build out more intelligent alerting systems, seek out potential threats to security and reliability, advocate solutions to these problems.
Development. Grow and expand infrastructure products and software automation using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
These are some of your traits:
You have worked in development before, acquiring a keen interest in Site Reliability, and love bringing infrastructure and your drive for development together.
You have a deep understanding of AWS. You understand the cloud better than you know yourself, strengths and weaknesses alike.
You’re comfortable with Docker and, preferably, proficient with Kubernetes.
You’ll bring a wealth of knowledge for scaling databases like ElasticSearch, Postgres, MongoDB, or others.
You have strong analytical and troubleshooting skills, thinking through big problems quickly is something you love.
You have scaled a large software system and want to do it again.
What to Expect from Crossbeam’s Interview Process
We go through the same interview steps for all Engineering candidates to ensure equity in our hiring process.
Our process is designed to learn as much about each candidate as possible, as well as to give candidates access to our team and learn about what it’s like to be an SRE at Crossbeam. Topics will range from Development experience to problem-solving approaches and collaboration.
Interview steps:
First-round call with a Crossbeam in-house recruiter
Take-Home Test
The final Interview is set up to meet multiple folks in succession, here’s who you will meet:
CTO
SRE
Director of Engineering
A few Developers
Customer Success & Product Management team members
Built-in 15 minute breaks for you and us!

Our team has always emphasized remote work, with teammates in the Philadelphia area and distributed across the country. We’re committed to a remote-first culture, with the majority of our collaborative work happening on Slack and Zoom.
When we’re able and when travel feels comfortable again, we’ll celebrate with team offsites and events about once a quarter, and welcome our remote team to join for some facetime whenever they can. In the meantime, we’re focused on creating the best experience possible for new team members from a distance.
This role can be based anywhere in the US.

Equity. We will build a workplace that ensures everyone has access to the same opportunities to share in our success.
This is Fun. Few people are lucky enough to do what we do. Follow the fun in every step of the journey.
Benefits

Health Care Plan (Medical, Dental & Vision)
Flexible PTO Policy
Parental leave
Stock Option Plan
401k Plan + Match
Fully remote candidates are encouraged to apply. We have an office in Center City Philadelphia which we’ve closed temporarily due to COVID-19, with everyone working remotely. When we’re comfortable reopening the office, local candidates are also welcome to work from our Center City Philadelphia headquarters some or all of the time.

What Is a Site Reliability Engineer?
A site reliability engineer specializes in site reliability engineering, or SRE, a specific branch of operations first pioneered by Google. You are responsible for ensuring that when a website decides to scale a particular feature for various users to access, it does not break the underlying software or website functions. This means you need to use analytical problem-solving skills to determine how to make specific features on a new software release work on top of existing source code.

Senior Site Reliability Engineer
Seeking a Senior Site Reliability Engineer that has both development and system administration experience with large systems who can use their experience to formulate and implement automation solutions to support our monitoring and system administration people in tasks that either are risky to the system, prone to mistakes, labor intensive, time consuming and repetitive. These can be tasks for which an SOP exists or could be developed but is likely not to be followed consistently. The idea is to create some sustainable tools as a force multiplier that don't function more poorly than the manual methods. Experience with the pros and cons of tools like SALT and PUPPET will be useful for some tasks but for other tasks we might build a GUI for the shift to perform tasks on the clusters (or to automate those tasks entirely) which will require development skills.

It’s when the International Space Station opened. It’s when the Prius was introduced in the U.S. And it’s a year after an everyday traveler on a flight to Mexico came across a problem. This everyday traveler realized that it was nearly impossible to find any unbiased information online about his intended destination. Everything he came across was sales materials and glossy photos and none of it seemed “real.” Fortunately this everyday traveler was an engineer, and our future CEO, Steve Kaufer. Later that year, he founded TripAdvisor in a small office above a pizza shop in Needham, Massachusetts.
Today, TripAdvisor is the world’s largest travel site. Trying to remember travel planning before TripAdvisor is like trying to remember life before Post-It Notes, or car GPS navigation systems, or email. Remember when we had to base our travel decisions on input from just a handful of people? When the only travel reviews were from guidebook writers, travel agents, or your aunt who went to Paris five years ago? Today, we base our decisions on reviews posted by millions of our fellow travelers, including dozens who were there just last week or even yesterday. Today, we’re empowered. We can plan our trips with the latest, freshest intel. If we’ve got questions, we can get answers in the forums. If we need answers on the road, we can get them via the world’s most popular travel app.
As a company, we’ve grown tremendously over the past 16 years. We’ve stayed close to our roots in Needham, Massachusetts, but are now in a brand new headquarters designed specifically to reflect our company’s style.

It’s when the International Space Station opened. It’s when the Prius was introduced in the U.S. And it’s a year after an everyday traveler on a flight to Mexico came across a problem. This everyday traveler realized that it was nearly impossible to find any unbiased information online about his intended destination. Everything he came across was sales materials and glossy photos and none of it seemed “real.” Fortunately this everyday traveler was an engineer, and our future CEO, Steve Kaufer. Later that year, he founded TripAdvisor in a small office above a pizza shop in Needham, Massachusetts.
Today, TripAdvisor is the world’s largest travel site. Trying to remember travel planning before TripAdvisor is like trying to remember life before Post-It Notes, or car GPS navigation systems, or email. Remember when we had to base our travel decisions on input from just a handful of people? When the only travel reviews were from guidebook writers, travel agents, or your aunt who went to Paris five years ago? Today, we base our decisions on reviews posted by millions of our fellow travelers, including dozens who were there just last week or even yesterday. Today, we’re empowered. We can plan our trips with the latest, freshest intel. If we’ve got questions, we can get answers in the forums. If we need answers on the road, we can get them via the world’s most popular travel app.

We have several different types of networks this role will be required to support, extend, and improve: traditional “bare metal” devices and circuits, multi-provider cloud environments, and third-party managed facilities. You will have the opportunity to support thousands of hosts throughout the world, with petabyte-scale data challenges.
Senior Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
Who We Are Looking For:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful network engineering projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You can code. At our scale we are not interested in “boutique” manual management of devices such as routers, switches, or firewalls. You code with languages such as Python, Go, or Ruby, use modern platforms such as Cumulus Linux, and tools such as Ansible, Chef, or Terraform. You believe strongly in “infrastructure as code.”
You are a broadly skilled engineer, focused on networking but with the breadth of knowledge necessary to support a wide variety of software and systems.
You understand network fundamentals and modern architectures. You know BGP well and can deploy and troubleshoot Internet routing. You are capable of deploying a service load balanced with Anycast/ECMP. You enjoy working with modern monitoring platforms such as Prometheus.
You are comfortable working on physical gear or in the cloud. Our hybrid environment requires an agnostic knowledge of infrastructure equally comfortable with traditional, physical networking equipment as well as the software abstractions present in cloud platform networking such as AWS.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
What We Care About:
What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you.
The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law.

Site Reliability Engineers also constantly test these systems for functionality in order to resolve issues before they arise. If prevention doesn’t occur, these professionals must implement solutions and document the stages of their work. Security is another big part of the job, so Site Reliability Engineers regularly check and test networks to ensure they are safe from cyber threats or bugs. SREs typically utilize programming languages and systems such as Java, C++ and Linux. A background in computer science is common for professional Site Reliability Engineers and soft skills, including working well with a team, having sharp analytical skills and the ability to multitask is key to success in this role.

They considered outsourcing their fulfilment but could not find a company that allowed them to remain in the driving seat of their growing business.
Paul and Martin soon created Huboo’s unique Hub Model.
Huboo was then founded. Huboo is not like any normal fulfilment warehouse, we have a specific Hub Model, which allows our Hub Managers to take ownership of their Hubs and be the point of contact for our clients. They are not only pickers and packers but are also account managers too. Huboo work with client selling through eBay, Amazon, and other channels. We are the fastest growing e-commerce fulfilment company in the UK and are looking for a Lead Site Reliability Engineer to join our exciting journey!

Most businesses must have a dependable computer system to keep their operations functioning as needed. It is the Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) who is needed when computer systems are not operating up to snuff. It is a job role Google created to dub software engineers who have a knack for developing systems.
Those interested in work as a Site Reliability Engineer will likely know that there is much more to this role than just building and maintaining computer systems – they are involved in all aspects of the application, software and system development. It is a career that experts agree will stay in-demand, particularly as the computer systems we rely on daily continue to evolve and become more complex through advances in technology.
To gain an entry-level role in Site Reliability Engineering, most employers like candidates to have a degree in computer science or a related field. There is also a certain level of experience a Site Reliability Engineer should have attained to enter the workforce, which may include:
An aptitude for various programming languages, including C++ and Java.
Familiarity with different operating systems, like Linux and cloud computing systems.
Being able to code software in response to system deficiencies.
Having working knowledge of automation technologies.
These are just a few examples, but it does help illustrate how highly technical SRE work can be. When preparing to work as a Site Reliability Engineer, be sure to have a thorough understanding of various IT tools.
Degrees and Experience
As mentioned, the degree needed to enter Site Reliability Engineering may depend on the hiring company, but for the most part, having a bachelor’s degree in computer science should be suitable. Some SREs may take it upon themselves to earn certification as a Site Reliability Engineer or as a certified software developer. The more education you amass, the more likely you are to get a better paying and more satisfying job position.
Experience invariably adds up to technical aptitudes, such as those listed above. These can be gained doing coursework while working at an internship, through online programs and working in a technical role that allowed you to handle various programming platforms, languages and operating systems previously. Many SREs have worked as systems administrators who integrate software components and manage complex computer systems, making them familiar with much of the work an SRE will undertake. Site Reliability Engineer is a cross-disciplinary role that is still evolving, making sure you are well adept for any technical duties you may be assigned is ideal.
Working as a Junior Level Site Reliability Engineer
Junior level Site Reliability Engineers have likely worked in their role for at least a couple years and are beginning to hone their skills and have added more reliable components to their toolbox. At the junior level, a Site Reliability Engineer has demonstrated that they are excelling in their role and are likely working on larger and more complex computer systems. They work alongside other SREs in a collaborative environment and together solve various issues with computer systems throughout their organization, using software engineering traits to create an operations function.
Moving up the Ranks
Site Reliability Engineers who wish to advance in their career can certainly do so with perseverance and flexibility. Being able to work well with others, adapting to new technologies and having an interest in making computer systems more efficient is a start, but standing out from the crowd can also be vital in a tech role such as this.
Say you are working on a relatively small team with other SREs but have a largescale project assigned to you that necessitates engineering parts of an immense quantity of a certain tech product. Assessing the situation and suggesting that you and your colleagues standardize your tools ensures that all products work the same and are completed more efficiently. More than that, this is the type of plan that will impress managers and get a Site Reliability Engineer moving up the ranks in no time.
Advance Your Career: How to Become a Senior Site Reliability Engineer
The road to a Senior Site Reliability Engineer position is paved with ambition and aptitude. As Site Reliability Engineers gain more experience and develop more technical knowledge, they are likely to find themselves leading SRE teams on more complex and largescale system projects. Taking on more responsibilities in addition to your regular duties is a great way to stand out, as is the willingness to help struggling colleagues.
Site Reliability Engineering is competitive and a relatively new field. Its roles are not always clearly defined yet, so making your mark in this field can mean you help outline what it means to be a Site Reliability Engineer as it continues evolving.
Study the Core Fields
To understand the core fields that makeup SRE is to understand the role of Site Reliability Engineer. These main areas of interest include automation and cloud computing. Automation allows technical components to install and upgrade themselves without human intervention and is the goal of all SRE work. Cloud computing has three main services – SaaS (software as a service), IaaS (infrastructure as a service) and PaaS (platform as a service) and understanding these will help Site Reliability Engineers understand how to best access information and data used by employees to troubleshoot and correct issues they are having.
It is key as Site Reliability Engineer to constantly improve your knowledge and strive to stay on top of technology shifts and trends. Attend seminars and conferences related to IT, take online courses and earn additional certifications as an SRE and network where possible to gain insights from your fellow SREs. Taking the time to brush up on your skills and gain additional experiences will make you an even more formidable Site Reliability Engineer.
Site Reliability Engineers do work that is similar to DevOps engineers, helping to create software that covers both developer and operational issues while a goal of making components automated. They are also roles that were borne out of necessity, doing untraditional work that fills a gap exposed as technologies evolve and expand. Familiarizing yourself with the work frontend and backend engineers is useful too, as these developers use a similar software as SREs while designing functional and aesthetic components that may help you as SRE better picture the user experience.
Site Reliability Engineer Job Description
Site Reliability Engineers manage, protect and develop systems and software in devices. Though at first, it may sound like an operations role, it differs in that SREs use the software as their primary method for extending and repairing code to shield systems from being undercut by errors and outages. For both small and large distributed systems, it is key for Site Reliability Engineers to implement solutions that are automated, making their complex technical processes more streamlined and efficient.
It was traditionally the work of operations teams to fix computer system errors, but the need for implementing automation and making systems more scalable lead to the development of engineers who excel in software, i.e. – the Site Reliability Engineer.
Managing and extending computer systems using software engineering tools.
Making complex systems scalable and more reliable.
Constantly implementing automation configuration where possible to increase efficiency.
Executing tests to check and evaluate systems and software.
Proficiency with tools like Git, Vim for advanced code editing, Linux operating system, Python programming language, testing tools and database management with MySQL.
Someone who can handle multiple complex systems and not shy away from the challenge of improving them.
The willingness to try new technologies and make them harmonize with existing systems to achieve better operations overall.
Excellent communication
Thriving as a member of a team
Excelling under pressure
The ability to think fast
A natural problem-solver
Attaining a senior position in SRE is immensely rewarding and may bring a Site Reliability Engineer to an interesting crossroads. Because the field of SRE is still being clarified, it is entirely conceivable that a senior Site Reliability Engineer will be happy to stay in a senior position until retiring. Others prefer to move on to a different field and use their skillsets to take on new challenges.
When senior Site Reliability Engineers do move on to a different career, it is usually to a similar role, such as in DevOps, as a DevOps engineering manager, overseeing the various DevOps teams that are in charge making software releases more efficient. Others prefer to stay in SRE but take on a managerial title and continue guiding and mentoring junior colleagues as well as the efforts of the entire SRE team.
Those continuing on as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer will continue to enjoy guiding their team to successful computer systems management and improvement through their extensive software abilities, as well as discover new and improved means shoring up systems glitches.

Job Description
This team currently consists of passionate engineers who strive to demonstrate excellence in the field of DevOps. We are not only responsible for the uptime of the various .COM websites and backend services, but a large portion of the job is to innovate. Historically, once the infrastructure is configured and working – it is mandated that there are no more changes to the system. Not here. We frequently and deliberately rebuild our entire system in an automated fashion. These activities help us not only discover pain points in our system, but it gives us the opportunity to improve continually. How do we guarantee geographic redundancy? How do we get the code to production faster? 15 minutes to rebuild a system, how can we get it down to 5? Instead of Mongo, should we use Cassandra or DynamoDB? Do we even need a database for this application? How can we orchestrate a cloud failover from one provider to another?
Who are we looking for?
The SRE Engineer is a part of an innovative team, who are on a continuous mission of building bulletproof, scalable, secure private and public cloud environments for our customers and users.
If you think hard is fun, and get bored easily if you aren’t challenged, this might be the place for you. We want someone who has an insatiable thirst for technology, desire to learn and grow – individually, with the team, and the business.

Work across the engineering team to influence software development to meet the cloud needs and influence product and cloud engineering to improve the manageability and the supportability of the cloud products.
Design and develop complete end to end automation environment using configuration/auto-scaling tools.
Lead architecture, monitoring, performance optimization and capacity planning of new infrastructure services to support a high-performance computing environment and ensure 99.9%+ uptime.

Founded in 2017, Huboo was created by e-commerce sellers for e-commerce sellers. Martin Bysh (CEO) and Paul Dodd (CTO) found that the demands and struggles that came with picking, packing, and shipping their products was becoming impossible. They considered outsourcing their fulfilment but could not find a company that allowed them to remain in the driving seat of their growing business.
Paul and Martin soon created Huboo’s unique Hub Model.
Huboo was then founded. Huboo is not like any normal fulfilment warehouse, we have a specific Hub Model, which allows our Hub Managers to take ownership of their Hubs and be the point of contact for our clients. They are not only pickers and packers but are also account managers too. Huboo work with client selling through eBay, Amazon, and other channels. We are the fastest growing e-commerce fulfilment company in the UK and are looking for a Lead Site Reliability Engineer to join our exciting journey!

By providing powerful new ways for people to connect with one another, gain greater access to education, entertainment, medical research, commerce, and much more, our team is empowering millions of customers worldwide.
We’re looking for passionate, innovative professionals to join our team and connect the world to more. You’ll work in a collaborative and inclusive environment that values diverse perspectives and continuous learning, and provides industry-leading benefits with unmatched opportunities for career growth. Our team is fearless in pursuit of new ideas and uncompromising in our quest to become the world’s first truly global Internet Service Provider. Interested in joining our mission? Take a look at career opportunities at Viasat today.
The Role
A Senior SRE Engineer to help our teams improve our infrastructure, monitoring and CI/CD in particular, to accelerate our ability to deliver rapid software updates to our customers.
Someone who knows what “infrastructure as code” means, experienced in explaining and delivering the advantages of good CI/CD capability. You are familiar with Linux containers (Docker preferably), can craft an automation script in Python, Ruby or any other languages - we are open minded. We are looking for someone who believes monitoring is not an option. We’re seeking a team player who can operate in a super friendly, open and supportive Engineering environment.
Responsibilities
At Viasat Europe, we have a number of product teams and we support them with a central SRE team. You can operate in a team of SRE engineers that collaborate closely with both development and support teams. Everything that we build and deploy is ultimately a Docker image that gets deployed to a Terraform defined and managed Docker cluster in AWS, across multiple AZs to ensure HA. Stateful services store data using replicated MySQL RDS instances, EFS, Redis. All configuration lives in deployment descriptor files in a Git repo which provides the Docker orchestrator all that it needs to deploy or update services. You deploy consistent images and service definitions across our Test, QA and Production environments, scaling out our clusters and/or individual service replicas to meet capacity demands with a single easy command, or automatically, as required. Monitoring, log aggregation and backup jobs are standard - just additional services deployed to the clusters in the same way as the apps.
When things go wrong -or weird- you provide production support to the support engineers, and assist in conducting post-mortems with the product development team and other stakeholders to continuously improve the reliability of our systems.
Requirements
A passion and talent for software development, with an appreciation of all the pieces of the puzzle that make it happen.
Production support experience, preferably supporting JVM based applications
Expertise in at least 2 of the modern languages: Java, Python, GoLang, NodeJS, Groovy, C#, Scala, etc.
A deep understanding of enabling technologies, principles and practices of Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment
Hands-on experience with at least one public cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.), including infrastructure and configuration management (Ansible, Chef, Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
Good understanding of platform and systems’ architecture – modular monoliths, SoA, microservices, including enabling tools and technologies (Spring Cloud, OpenShift, Kubernetes, CloudFoundry, etc.)
Working knowledge of modern ops technologies, e.g. monitoring, log aggregation, alerting, service discovery.
Experience working with agile frameworks, having inspected and adapted them to work for you and your teams.
Skills
Experience working within cross-functional delivery teams, collaborating across: UX, Service Delivery, Product Engineering, Support Ops.
Appreciation of what motivates, inspires and stifles software teams.
Experience with data engineering and analytics technologies, e.g. Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Cassandra.
Good understanding of the secure and reliable integration between components in modern applications: backend to web and mobile front-end
General understanding of technologies used in modern web and mobile applications would be advantageous.
Experience of running Kubernetes in production would be very appreciated

Opis delovnega mesta
Visionect is currently looking for a senior systems engineer with experience with Linux systems and who will help the team to scale using modern DevOps/SRE practices.
You will help us deploy, manage and monitor internal systems and external services infrastructure. You will help us upgrade and migrate our existing systems to a more container centric approach as well as build the next generation of services which will be key for future growth.
We're a very pragmatic and frugal company, and we've always used a mix of bare metal, virtualized, cloud-based (IaaS) and on-premises servers, running everything from web pages, various web apps (Python, Golang) to our Visionect Server, a custom thin-client server and a key ingredient in our electronic paper platform.
Last year we've started a comprehensive migration towards containers and we run 99% of services through Docker and Kubernetes. Our cloud provider of choice is Google, but we're looking to build solutions vendor agnostic.
We've been influenced heavily by Google's way of running production systems and we're trying to follow the practices explained in Site Reliability Engineering - https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html - to the extent possible at our current scale.
This is not a ""GUI administrator"" position - you'll be working as an engineer expected to help develop various services and systems that will simplify operations for the rest of the team.
Finally - we focus on our own products and do not do project work for our customers so most of the time you'll be working with our development teams helping them with Visionect's existing and future products. Visionect is currently world-wide leader in epaper & digital signage solutions and you'll help us retain this position.
Your tasks include:
- Daily operations: Deploying, management and monitoring of servers and services.
- Improving internal processes: Adding automation wherever sensible, making sure we're not wasting time on mindless drone tasks while at the same time improving QA.
- Support to developers: Working with developers and providing them with support during development as well as guidance on how to improve (aka ""SRE embed"").
- Architectural work: we're building the next generation of our infrastructure and your input will be needed to help us decide what direction should we go.
Od kandidatov zahtevamo
Required skills:
- Expert knowledge of Linux/*nix system administration
- Programing experience
- Experience with modern DevOps practices (server orchestration, configuration management, automated deploys, monitoring, ... )
- Experience with containers (Docker, rkt,...)
- Experience with IaaS providers (you've deployed services on AWS, Azure or similar)
- Experience with good security practices
Big plus:
- Good programming skills (especially if you're versed in Python or Go Lang)
- Proper infrastructure experience - you've deployed a global service with more than just a handful of users in production
- Network communication security on the level of networking protocols - you would know how to protect a custom networking protocol running on top of TCP/IP against various attacks
- Kubernetes experience - especially if you've run K8S in production
- Google Cloud Platform experience
Kandidatom ponujamo
Position is a senior position - you'll be working directly with the CTO and other team leads. You'll have an opportunity to lead the whole systems engineering team if you'll perform.
We're cultivating a very open and inclusive environment, where everybody is expected to be a team player and voice opinions as well as listen to others. We take care of personal development making sure that our coworkers develop themselves and not just code.
Position is open at our headquarters in Ljubljana. We're looking for candidates with multiple years experience. The position is long-term with a probationary period of 6 months.

We are a startup based in Helsinki, Finland. Callstats.io is our first product, built to monitor and manage the media quality in realtime communication applications. We often refer to callstats.io as ""Google Analytics for WebRTC"". Our vision is a world where communication is both frictionless and effortless to set up, operate, and scale. We collect millions of network and media quality metrics from our customers around the world. We analyze, cluster, and categorize them based on various attributes. Our cloud infrastructure creates reports and alerts the customers when their users experience degrades. Our systems also attempt to automagically fix issues. The optimizations empower our customers to provide a superior service quality compared to their competitors. Our team is made up of engineers that have shipped code for various networking companies.
Are you the Site Reliability Engineer we're looking for?
Our engineers write great code, test it, care about performance, and pragmatically tackle the technical debt, all while improving the maintainability of our code base. Our solutions aim to excite our customers daily. Data is the most critical part of our product and we're constantly raising the bar on the user experience we provide. But Rome wasn't built in a day. All our projects started small and gradually began to increase in complexity. We're constantly shipping code and we believe that done is better than perfect. Does that sound like a team after your own heart? We want to hear from you! You have strong fundamentals in algorithms, data structures, statistics, and networking. You love prototyping new tools and features that may help our customers make better data-driven decisions. You're comfortable working with Python, C, C++, Java and JavaScript, among other languages, and are excited about using new languages and tools as needed. If that's you, introduce yourself and let's build great things together! What is the hardest real-world distributed system or networking problem that you have ever diagnosed and perhaps solved? Explain it in your cover letter in as much detail as you can. We love reading about reverse engineering.
What we'd like to see in the candidate:
You are fluent in at least one of the following languages: BASH, Python, or JavaScript.
You have hands-on experience in managing some of the following server components: Kafka, Mongo DB, Postgres SQL, Redis/Hazelcast, or AWS Lambda.
You have an interest in deploying continuous integration, log collection, and analysis (ELK stack), or monitoring and optimizing our deployment cluster’s performance.
You follow the DRY principles and attempt to automate everything.
You are able to perform root cause analysis when outages occur or performance degrades.
Compensation and perks
Let's talk about your salary and benefits!
Education: Our commitment to learning as a team and individual growth, also hackathons.
Fun times: Weekly and monthly outings, sports.
Great team: Our team is sharp, eccentric, loyal, and ambitious.
Friday demo: Every week you get to show off your contributions and get immediate feedback.
Immediate impact: You are part of a small but growing team and your impact is immediately felt. There is no shortage of interesting and challenging tasks.

We love automating tasks. We will utilise your experience in using Python, Ruby, Unix Shell (Bash, Ksh), Perl, etc. to automate any manual processes.
Do you have experience installing, configuring, administering, and tuning of JavaEE application servers/containers? If yes, great. We currently use Tomcat, WebSphere, etc in a Linux environment
Experience which stands out for us for the role of DevOps Engineer (Site Reliability):
Bachelor's Degree in computer science or equivalent experience.
A real passion for innovation! Any experience with Cloud Platforms like AWS, GCP and Deploying and automating infrastructure/applications using Chef, RPM, Docker, AWS (ECS, ECR), Terraform, etc. will help us on our exciting journey.
We are a data driven business. Therefore, experience with database (RDBMS, NoSQL) technologies would be beneficial. This is not essential, as you can learn with us.

Codemill sells and develops video apps for the World's leading media companies. In the past years, we have made great progress at Codemill and we have expanded our knowledge, skills, and number of employees. We recently got introduced to the stock market and we see a continued growth after the summer as well, so this is why we are now looking for more talented people to join our great staff!
We are currently building the next-generation online tool, Accurate Video, that is used within the media and broadcasting business. Our tools help our customers to work remotely in an efficient manner and manage quality control, marketing, editing, automatic adjustments, and AI services.

We value the sense of community and collaboration and we think that it’s very important to make our co-workers feel comfortable at work. To further the great atmosphere and work environment we have breakfast together every morning and on Fridays, our popcorn machine works hard to provide us with popcorn for the day (on hold due to Covid-19). We, of course, also have benefits to promote good health and teamwork.
In these pandemic times (and afterward) we are using digital technologies to maintain our good collaboration in our geographically distributed team.

The daily work includes close collaboration with your colleagues within development, product, and sales in building, optimizing, and securing our infrastructure and product workflows. You will report to your Team Manager and together you will have regular follow-ups to make sure that you are satisfied with your work situation and have the opportunity to develop your competence.
Your Qualifications
In order to succeed in this position, you should be passionate about building systems that are highly reliable, maintainable, and scalable. It's preferable if you have experience from managing, monitoring, and optimizing the infrastructure and security of applications and processes.
As a person you are service-oriented, enjoy collaborating with others, curious to learn new things and willing to share your knowledge.

Distributed systems, their complexities, and challenges.
Amazon Web Services.

Solid understanding of CI & CD.
Linux experience.
Containerization technologies (E.g. Docker.)
Software development (Preferably Java, Python, Go and Test Driven Development)

Site Reliability Engineer
Description
Mux is building the future of online video infrastructure. Our first product was analytics and performance monitoring - think “NewRelic for Video” - used by major video streaming companies like PBS, Vimeo, and The New York Times to monitor and improve billions of streams. We just announced Mux Video, a simple API to video hosting, encoding and streaming - think ""Stripe for Video"" - which uses our performance data, machine learning, and just-in-time encoding for unmatched video quality and efficiency. POST a video in; GET a video out that plays anywhere and is deeply optimized for the target device and user. Upcoming features like audio transcription and face detection will allow for even more creative uses of the API. We think building with video should be fun, not complicated.
Requirements
As an SRE at Mux, you will help develop and maintain globally distributed multi-cloud applications running in containers on Kubernetes. You will work across the entire stack, from application logic to ""infrastructure as code"", with the goal of ensuring reliability and visibility into production systems while also supporting development velocity for the team.

Our Ideal Candidate:
4+ years of engineering experience. You're a strong engineer comfortable working across multiple platforms and environments.
Solid engineering fundamentals (CS degree a plus).
Expert level knowledge of a systems programming language (Go, Rust, C++, etc.).
Experience in managing, monitoring, and optimizing the performance of production cloud applications.
Experience deploying containers in a production environment (bonus for K8s experience).
Proficiency handling networking challenges related to cross-region and cross-cloud deployments.
Video experience a plus but not required.
Benefits
You'll be joining an amazing team from places like Google/YouTube, Amazon/Twitch, and Brightcove. Our founders previously started (and sold) Zencoder, an early leader in cloud video technology. We also authored Video.js, the biggest HTML5 video player on the web. We were named one of the best Y Combinator startups of 2016, and we recently raised a Series A from Accel, joining existing investors SV Angel, Lowercase, the founders of Heroku, Parse, and others.
A supportive culture that cares about both excellent work and work-life balance

Sr. Linux Systems Administrator/Site Reliability Engineer
We're a ~250 person strong internet company in Seattle that prides itself on open-source and DIY thinking and ability. We don't use like to use fancy vendors; we build things ourselves. We're an established, 20+ year old, privately owned, stable, and profitable company.
Our team is a group of talented SRE & operations engineers with a large amount of high-volume web and systems experience. We believe that the most challenging problems are best solved with KISS philosophy and a cold beer.
If you enjoy building creative solutions with open source platforms to solve challenging and difficult problems, we'd love to hear from you.
Experience that we're looking for:
5+ yrs of high-volume production web/site reliability engineering experience (we handle thousands of Debian hosts and serve millions of customers per day)
*nix kernels, filesystems, security, and internals
familiarity with container technology, docker, kubernetes, etc
distributed storage, ceph in particular
MySQL/MariaDB, complex replication, and dealing with large datasets
strong proficiency with shell or python
strong troubleshooting and root-cause analytical skills
Bonus:
strong networking background - we have a multi-pop international network and a strong familiarity with major routing/switching protocols and equipment is a bonus
Personality we're looking for:
Self-driven; we have a very flat management structure. As a senior engineer, you'll be expected to have a strong sense of ownership, urgency, and skill to manage yourself, and learn our platforms and deliver solutions quickly. We throw you in the technical deep end to see if you can swim.
Ability, experience, and determination count much more than certifications or college degrees. You'll be hired and advance based off of your technical ability and contribution.
A very good sense of humor.
Responsibilities:
Deal with daily operations and site reliability engineering tasks ranging anywhere from server administration, designing architecture, to advising software engineers on best practices.
Continuously improve our systems! We're primarily LAMP, but run complex implementations of things like Puppet, Redis, and ElasticSearch.
Participate in a 3-tier on-call rotation and work to improve systems and redundancy to prevent calls.
We offer very competitive pay, medical/dental/vision benefits, 401(k) with a 50% contribution match (no limit), flex-time, subsidized transportation passes/parking & fitness membership, and a profit sharing program with no vesting period. Additional perks include: catered lunches, company paid trips, bagel/fruit Fridays, team events/lunches, family picnics, holiday dinners/parties, occasional happy hours, and a very fun and laid back work environment.

Stack Overflow is growing fast, and our infrastructure needs just keep getting bigger. We’re looking for a senior sysadmin to join our team of extraordinary sysadmins and developers working on sites that see 4000-6000 hits per second during peak times.
In addition to having a passion for working with software and keeping a top 50 website on the web, you should love hardware. We love pushing hardware as hard as we possibly can. This means hands-on maintenance from time to time. We require our SREs to be good coders. We are a mixed Windows and Linux shop; you should be highly proficient in one and comfortable with the other.
At Stack Overflow we’re passionate about our technology. We own and operate our own infrastructure, and take the time to do it right. We like to stay on the cutting edge of technology, so you will always be working with or working towards using the latest and greatest there is. We get all the hardware we need for redundancy and performance.
Because we take the time to do things right, our on call responsibilities are very light. We get paged very infrequently.

You're not like everyone else.
You bring a unique perspective to the table. Transparency tops your list of values. Your smarts and creativity are off the charts, matched only by your humility. You want to collaborate with a team of diverse talent. You proactively contribute to a culture of respect and inclusion.
You enjoy a challenge.
Inquisitive and focused, you see every challenge as an opportunity. You're ambitious and unafraid to make mistakes because you learn from them and bounce back quickly. You don't stop until you get it right. ""Impossible"" isn't in your vocabulary. You're more interested in creating the future than waiting for it.
You love to listen.
You start every interaction from a place of listening and seeking to understand. You're culturally connected. You remember your first concert. You can readily recommend a binge-worthy show on Netflix, Hulu or HBO. You can't sit in traffic without a great audiobook, podcast or album. You can make a killer playlist. Your idea of a good weekend includes watching a movie or playing a video game.

• Building and Automating: You’re intimately familiar with architecting and securing cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure). You have deployed and maintained orchestration frameworks like Ansible, Puppet or Chef and used them as the foundation for your work. You have experience building and orchestrating containerized services (Kubernetes, Docker). Your experience with scripting and programming languages like Ruby, Python, Node, C++ or Go helps you turn tools in to platforms.
• Measuring, Monitoring and Scale: You ensure everything you build is operationally excellent. You build metrics and logging in to everything you do, and you know how to collect, correlate and report based on them in a centralized logging platform (ELK, Splunk).

Description
This is an unusual job, unlike others in the industry. Like traditional operations groups, we keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite weather issues, bandwidth outages, and configuration problems. Unlike traditional operations groups, we also have full access to and authority to fix, extend, and scale the code to keep it working and harden it against all the vagaries of the Internet. We hire people from both systems and software backgrounds. Strong candidates will have experience with both. Just as what we do is unique, where we do it is unique too. We’re Ocado Technology. We architect and build the ground-breaking, game-changing technology solutions that power Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer. We don’t do off-the-shelf. We don’t do easy. Because we’re writing, building and running all our own software systems, we’re constantly pushing the limits of what technology can do. And when we say ‘we’, we mean ‘you’. Join us and you’ll work across a phenomenal breadth of technology, with incredibly smart people, to create reliable, resilient, scalable and optimised software systems. In SRE, we flip between the fine-grained detail of disk driver I/O scheduling to the big picture of forward planning service capacity, across a range of systems and technologies.

With more than 270 staff and contractors worldwide, we’ve helped a community of creative sellers earn more than $400 Million. Millions of people around the world choose our marketplace, studio and courses to buy files, hire freelancers, or learn the skills needed to build websites, videos, apps, graphics and more.

What we’re looking for
You will have built and managed large scale, web facing systems serving millions of requests a month while still supporting many deploys a day. You understand that configuring and managing this scale of infrastructure requires a fully-automated infrastructure provisioning toolset. You need to have a broad knowledge of system administration, networking, databases, security, storage and performance and have expertise in at least one of these disciplines.
You align with the goals of the DevOps movement in improving collaboration between the development and operations disciplines.
What you’ll be doing

Our development team will typically deploy the entire application 15-20 times per day and we are deploying software-defined infrastructure updates many times a week. Our traffic is 24/7 so there no “quiet periods” for maintenance. All this combined means you are unlikely to find a more challenging role of this kind in Australia.

Klaviyo is using technology to reinvent email marketing from the ground up. For too long marketing has been pretty selfish. Companies blast everyone with the same email, not because they think that’s what customers want, but because they don’t have a choice.
Klaviyo fundamentally changes the game. Our software ties together everything companies know about their customers, processes massive quantities of data in real-time, and uses it drive a platform that’s part CRM, part analytics engine and 100% an email platform that gets results.
Technology has come a long way in the last 15 years, but email hasn’t really changed. We’re here to fix that.
About the Role
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is essentially what you get when you treat system operations as if it is a software problem.

About Klaviyo
Email will no longer suck. Klaviyo is using technology to reinvent email marketing from the ground up. For too long marketing has been pretty selfish. Companies blast everyone with the same email, not because they think that’s what customers want, but because they don’t have a choice.
Klaviyo fundamentally changes the game. Our software ties together everything companies know about their customers, processes massive quantities of data in real-time, and uses it drive a platform that’s part CRM, part analytics engine and 100% an email platform that gets results.
Technology has come a long way in the last 15 years, but email hasn’t really changed. We’re here to fix that.
About the Role
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is essentially what you get when you treat system operations as if it is a software problem.

Klaviyo is a high growth technology driven company and is passionate about the user experience of its application and the well orchestrated operations of its service infrastructure. The SRE team works on its own initiatives to build foundational backend services but also builds tooling and automation to allow product teams to release and scale their software predictably.
SREs are team players and embed themselves within product teams to advance the architecture and performance of software systems and to train their peers in topics such as debugging distributed systems, building self-healing capabilities or eking out every drop of performance possible.
As a Site Reliability Engineer you will have ownership of foundational Klaviyo services and a big impact on our product teams. Klaviyo’s infrastructure, event processing, and team have grown 300% year over year so there are always new skills to learn and technical challenges to solve the right way.

Description
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what you get when you treat operations as if it’s a software problem. Our mission is to progress, protect, and provide for the software and systems behind all of Ocado Technology’s services with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and capacity. This is an unusual job, unlike others in the industry. Like traditional operations groups, we keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite weather issues, bandwidth outages, and configuration problems. Unlike traditional operations groups, we also have full access to and authority to fix, extend, and scale the code to keep it working and harden it against all the vagaries of the Internet. We hire people from both systems and software backgrounds. Strong candidates will have experience with both. Just as what we do is unique, where we do it is unique too. We’re Ocado Technology. We architect and build the ground-breaking, game-changing technology solutions that power Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer. We don’t do off-the-shelf. We don’t do easy. Because we’re writing, building and running all our own software systems, we’re constantly pushing the limits of what technology can do. And when we say ‘we’, we mean ‘you’. Join us and you’ll work across a phenomenal breadth of technology, with incredibly smart people, to create reliable, resilient, scalable and optimised software systems. In SRE, we flip between the fine-grained detail of disk driver I/O scheduling to the big picture of forward planning service capacity, across a range of systems and technologies. We own those services in production. We drive reliability and performance across massive scale by mastering the full depth of the stack. We literally do learn something new every day - usually surprising things - that have the potential to transform the lives of our users around the world. As a Systems Engineer on the SRE team, you will work on large-scale system design and troubleshooting, and be fluent in systems programming and/or automation. You will have a desire to tackle the complex problems of scale. Familiarity with running production environments at scale is crucial in this job along with an in-depth understanding of Unix systems internals, and networking. Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technology Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Ocado Smart Platform, we make our services best-in-breed. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We're always on call to keep our services up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.
Responsibilities
Design, write and deliver software to improve the availability, scalability, latency, and efficiency of Ocado’s services.
Solve problems relating to mission critical services and build automation to prevent problem recurrence; with the goal of automating response to all non-exceptional service conditions.
Influence and create new designs, architectures, standards and methods for large-scale distributed systems.
Engage in service capacity planning and demand forecasting, software performance analysis and system tuning.
Conduct periodic on call duties.
Qualifications
Minimum qualifications:
BS degree in Computer Science or related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
Experience in one or more of: Java, Python, NodeJS, Scala, or scripting experience in Shell.
Experience working with Unix/Linux systems from kernel to shell and beyond, with experience working with system libraries, file systems, and client-server protocols.
Networking: experience with network theory e.g. TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, etc., MAC addresses, IP packets, DNS, OSI layers, and load balancing.
Preferred qualifications:
Expertise in designing, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems.
In-depth knowledge of operating systems (processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they work).
Familiarity with algorithms, data structures and complexity analysis.
Systematic problem solving approach, coupled with a strong sense of ownership and drive.

Description
This is an unusual job, unlike others in the industry. Like traditional operations groups, we keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite weather issues, bandwidth outages, and configuration problems. Unlike traditional operations groups, we also have full access to and authority to fix, extend, and scale the code to keep it working and harden it against all the vagaries of the Internet. We hire people from both systems and software backgrounds. Strong candidates will have experience with both. Just as what we do is unique, where we do it is unique too. We’re Ocado Technology. We architect and build the ground-breaking, game-changing technology solutions that power Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer. We don’t do off-the-shelf. We don’t do easy. Because we’re writing, building and running all our own software systems, we’re constantly pushing the limits of what technology can do. And when we say ‘we’, we mean ‘you’. Join us and you’ll work across a phenomenal breadth of technology, with incredibly smart people, to create reliable, resilient, scalable and optimised software systems. In SRE, we flip between the fine-grained detail of disk driver I/O scheduling to the big picture of forward planning service capacity, across a range of systems and technologies. We own those services in production. We drive reliability and performance across massive scale by mastering the full depth of the stack. We literally do learn something new every day - usually surprising things - that have the potential to transform the lives of our users around the world. As a Software Engineer on the SRE team, you will have the opportunity to tackle the complex problems while using your expertise in coding, algorithms, complexity analysis and large-scale system design. Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technology Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Ocado Smart Platform, we make our services best-in-breed. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We're always on call to keep our services up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.
Responsibilities
Design, write and deliver software to improve the availability, scalability, latency, and efficiency of Ocado’s services.
Solve problems relating to mission critical services and build automation to prevent problem recurrence; with the goal of automating response to all non-exceptional service conditions.
Influence and create new designs, architectures, standards and methods for large-scale distributed systems.
Engage in service capacity planning and demand forecasting, software performance analysis and system tuning.

What You Will Do
You will be a member of a six-person Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team responsible for maintaining and evolving the operational infrastructure for the Let’s Encrypt certificate authority. You will work closely with our application software developers and management to plan and implement the future of the certificate authority, its software applications, and its policies and procedures.
We provide secure and reliable service to more than 150 million websites around the world. We expect this number to grow rapidly. As such it’s a unique opportunity to have an enormous impact on creating a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.
In some organizations, the people responsible for deploying applications are left out of the full application development lifecycle. They are simply handed something at the end and told “make this run reliably, securely, and efficiently” while the infrastructure management role is devalued or taken for granted. That is not how we do things at Let’s Encrypt. SRE is part of the application development lifecycle from start to finish and we heavily invest in enabling and building infrastructure that is reliable, secure, and efficient. SRE is given latitude, time, and resources to do things The Right Way.
Automation is central to everything you and your team will build and maintain. You will automate operations extensively for the sake of security, scalability, correctness, compliance, and financial efficiency. You will make sure that when something does need to be done manually, it can be done in a safe and efficient manner. Our focus on automation means we are particularly interested in candidates with software engineering skills.
Our physical infrastructure includes servers, storage, switches, firewalls, and HSMs deployed across two highly secure data centers. While the majority of our infrastructure runs on our own hardware, we do use external cloud and CDN providers for some peripheral systems.
We use open source software (e.g. Linux, Prometheus, Grafana, SaltStack) extensively and prefer it when it can get the job done. The core CA application software that your team will be responsible for deploying is open source and written by our software development team.
Effective engineers know how to properly prioritize and communicate well. We will be looking for those skills in candidates.
Requirements
Two years professional experience as a software developer
An understanding of why writing tests for software is critical
A willingness to travel approximately three times per year
A willingness to be on-call (time split between six people)
Personal organization ability so that people can depend on you (e.g. task lists, calendar management)
Skills You Will Need to Develop
We write most of our code in Go and Python. You don’t need to know these languages coming in but you will need to learn them.
You will need to develop systems and network administration skills if you haven’t already. This means, for example, learning to manage firewalls and routers, work with automation tools like SaltStack, and manage virtual machines on both physical and cloud infrastructure.
You will need to gain domain-specific knowledge (e.g. PKI) but you don’t need to know it coming in.
Location and Benefits
This is a remote position available anywhere in the United States or Canada.
Benefits include excellent health insurance, a 100% match for 401k contributions, and flexible time off and parental leave policies.

Description
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what you get when you treat operations as if it’s a software problem. Our mission is to progress, protect, and provide for the software and systems behind all of Ocado Technology’s services with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and capacity. This is an unusual job, unlike others in the industry. Like traditional operations groups, we keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite weather issues, bandwidth outages, and configuration problems. Unlike traditional operations groups, we also have full access to and authority to fix, extend, and scale the code to keep it working and harden it against all the vagaries of the Internet. We hire people from both systems and software backgrounds. Strong candidates will have experience with both. Just as what we do is unique, where we do it is unique too. We’re Ocado Technology. We architect and build the ground-breaking, game-changing technology solutions that power Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer. We don’t do off-the-shelf. We don’t do easy. Because we’re writing, building and running all our own software systems, we’re constantly pushing the limits of what technology can do. And when we say ‘we’, we mean ‘you’. Join us and you’ll work across a phenomenal breadth of technology, with incredibly smart people, to create reliable, resilient, scalable and optimised software systems. In SRE, we flip between the fine-grained detail of disk driver I/O scheduling to the big picture of forward planning service capacity, across a range of systems and technologies. We own those services in production. We drive reliability and performance across massive scale by mastering the full depth of the stack. We literally do learn something new every day - usually surprising things - that have the potential to transform the lives of our users around the world. As a Systems Engineer on the SRE team, you will work on large-scale system design and troubleshooting, and be fluent in systems programming and/or automation. You will have a desire to tackle the complex problems of scale. Familiarity with running production environments at scale is crucial in this job along with an in-depth understanding of Unix systems internals, and networking. Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technology Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Ocado Smart Platform, we make our services best-in-breed. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We're always on call to keep our services up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.
Responsibilities
Design, write and deliver software to improve the availability, scalability, latency, and efficiency of Ocado’s services.
Solve problems relating to mission critical services and build automation to prevent problem recurrence; with the goal of automating response to all non-exceptional service conditions.
Influence and create new designs, architectures, standards and methods for large-scale distributed systems.
Engage in service capacity planning and demand forecasting, software performance analysis and system tuning.
Conduct periodic on call duties.
Qualifications
Minimum qualifications:
BS degree in Computer Science or related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
Experience in one or more of: Java, Python, NodeJS, Scala, or scripting experience in Shell.
Experience working with Unix/Linux systems from kernel to shell and beyond, with experience working with system libraries, file systems, and client-server protocols.
Networking: experience with network theory e.g. TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, etc., MAC addresses, IP packets, DNS, OSI layers, and load balancing.
Preferred qualifications:
Expertise in designing, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems.
In-depth knowledge of operating systems (processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they work).
Familiarity with algorithms, data structures and complexity analysis.
Systematic problem solving approach, coupled with a strong sense of ownership and drive.

About Klaviyo
Email will no longer suck. Klaviyo is using technology to reinvent email marketing from the ground up. For too long marketing has been pretty selfish. Companies blast everyone with the same email, not because they think that’s what customers want, but because they don’t have a choice.
Klaviyo fundamentally changes the game. Our software ties together everything companies know about their customers, processes massive quantities of data in real-time, and uses it drive a platform that’s part CRM, part analytics engine and 100% an email platform that gets results.
Technology has come a long way in the last 15 years, but email hasn’t really changed. We’re here to fix that.
About the Role
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is essentially what you get when you treat system operations as if it is a software problem. The mission of the Site Reliability Engineering team is to ensure uninterrupted service for Klaviyo customers and act as force multiplier for Klaviyo product teams to deliver better software faster.
Klaviyo is a high growth technology driven company and is passionate about the user experience of its application and the well orchestrated operations of its service infrastructure. The SRE team works on its own initiatives to build foundational backend services but also builds tooling and automation to allow product teams to release and scale their software predictably.
SREs are team players and embed themselves within product teams to advance the architecture and performance of software systems and to train their peers in topics such as debugging distributed systems, building self-healing capabilities or eking out every drop of performance possible.
As a Site Reliability Engineer you will have ownership of foundational Klaviyo services and a big impact on our product teams. Klaviyo’s infrastructure, event processing, and team have grown 300% year over year so there are always new skills to learn and technical challenges to solve the right way.

Description
We are Ocado Technology. We architect and build the ground-breaking solutions that power Ocado, the world’s largest online-only grocery supermarket.
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what you get when you treat operations like a software problem. We want you, the Software Engineer, to design an operations function and we are creating a completely new team for you to be part of. An exciting time to join would you not agree?
You will be part of an organisation that lives and breathes technology. We don’t do off-the-shelf. We don’t do easy. Because we’re writing, building and running all our own software systems, we’re constantly pushing the limits of what technology can do.
The new SRE team will be doing work that has historically been done by an operations team, but using engineers with software expertise.
What are we looking for?
Someone with good software skills, who also is an expert in network engineering or system administration. Typically, we look for about a 50/50 mix of people who have more of a software background and people who have more of a systems engineering background. We feel this would be a really good mix.
Where and how many SREs?
Good question. We are a growing company, with revenues over £1 billion and we are investing heavily in SREs. We will be recruiting across our international offices alongside a new team to be created in the UK. Joining now will give you the unique opportunity to be part of and shape the team’s development and make a real difference to your own career and Ocado Technology.
In a nutshell
As a Software Engineer on the SRE team, you will have the opportunity to tackle the complex problems while using your expertise in coding, algorithms, complexity analysis and large-scale system design. Your tasks will focus on operational assets of the software. You will be part of the team that uses software instead of people to run operations on site.
What will I be doing
Design, write and deliver software to improve the availability, scalability, latency, and efficiency of Ocado’s services.
Solve problems relating to mission critical services and build automation to prevent problem recurrence; with the goal of automating response to all non-exceptional service conditions.
Influence and create new designs, architectures, standards and methods for large-scale distributed systems.
Engage in service capacity planning and demand forecasting, software performance analysis and system tuning.
Working in cloud environment with instrumentation and automation in mind.
What I need to know
Experience with algorithms, data structures, complexity analysis and software design.
Experience in one or more of: Java, Python, NodeJS, Scala.
Expertise in designing, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems.
Experience in cloud environments.
Familiarity with running web services at scale; understanding of Unix systems internals and networking.
Understanding of Unix/Linux systems from kernel to shell and beyond, taking in system libraries, file systems, and client-server protocols along the way.
Networking: knowledge and understanding of network theory, such as different protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, etc), MAC addresses, IP packets, DNS, OSI layers, and load balancing).
Systematic problem solving approach, coupled with a strong sense of ownership and drive.
What we can offer you
Technically stretching work is a given. We want you to push technological boundaries and create solutions to problems people haven’t even thought about yet; so we’ll give you the freedom and the tools and the playful, stimulating working environment you need to do what’s never been done before. While red tape’s conspicuous by its absence, rewards are plentiful: as well as a competitive salary and share schemes, benefits include pension scheme, interest-free season ticket loan, free shuttle bus from Hatfield train station and, of course, a healthy 15% Ocado staff discount (and free delivery). We also have Friday socials on the first Friday of every month, sports clubs such as badminton, running and table tennis (and many more) not to mention our frequently used football table.
Find out more about Ocado Technology at www.ocadotechnology.com
Please note that due to the high volume of applications we will be in contact with shortlisted candidates only. If you have not heard from us within 4 weeks, please assume your application has been unsuccessful on this occasion.
Due to the fast paced nature of Ocado's business our vacancy close dates may be subject to change.

Blockchain is the world's leading software platform for digital assets. Offering the largest production blockchain platform in the world, we share the passion to code, create, and ultimately build an open, accessible and fair financial future, one piece of software at a time.
We are looking for a Senior Site Reliability Engineer to join our engineering team as we tackle some some of the most interesting problems in the crypto space, like how do we securely scale a distributed financial platform that touches millions of people a day.
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps, is an engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Blockchain’s services are reliable and available meeting our users' and the business's needs, and delivers a fast rate of improvement while keeping an ever-watchful eye on capacity and performance.
At Blockchain, SRE is also a mindset and a set of engineering approaches to running better production systems—we build our own creative engineering solutions to operations problems.

Description
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what you get when you treat operations as if it’s a software problem. Our mission is to progress, protect, and provide for the software and systems behind all of Ocado Technology’s services with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and capacity. This is an unusual job, unlike others in the industry. Like traditional operations groups, we keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite weather issues, bandwidth outages, and configuration problems. Unlike traditional operations groups, we also have full access to and authority to fix, extend, and scale the code to keep it working and harden it against all the vagaries of the Internet. We hire people from both systems and software backgrounds. Strong candidates will have experience with both. Just as what we do is unique, where we do it is unique too. We’re Ocado Technology. We architect and build the ground-breaking, game-changing technology solutions that power Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer. We don’t do off-the-shelf. We don’t do easy. Because we’re writing, building and running all our own software systems, we’re constantly pushing the limits of what technology can do. And when we say ‘we’, we mean ‘you’. Join us and you’ll work across a phenomenal breadth of technology, with incredibly smart people, to create reliable, resilient, scalable and optimised software systems. In SRE, we flip between the fine-grained detail of disk driver I/O scheduling to the big picture of forward planning service capacity, across a range of systems and technologies. We own those services in production. We drive reliability and performance across massive scale by mastering the full depth of the stack. We literally do learn something new every day - usually surprising things - that have the potential to transform the lives of our users around the world. As a Systems Engineer on the SRE team, you will work on large-scale system design and troubleshooting, and be fluent in systems programming and/or automation. You will have a desire to tackle the complex problems of scale. Familiarity with running production environments at scale is crucial in this job along with an in-depth understanding of Unix systems internals, and networking. Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technology Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Ocado Smart Platform, we make our services best-in-breed. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We're always on call to keep our services up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.
Responsibilities
Design, write and deliver software to improve the availability, scalability, latency, and efficiency of Ocado’s services.
Solve problems relating to mission critical services and build automation to prevent problem recurrence; with the goal of automating response to all non-exceptional service conditions.
Influence and create new designs, architectures, standards and methods for large-scale distributed systems.
Engage in service capacity planning and demand forecasting, software performance analysis and system tuning.
Conduct periodic on call duties.
Qualifications
Minimum qualifications:
BS degree in Computer Science or related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
Experience in one or more of: Java, Python, NodeJS, Scala, or scripting experience in Shell.
Experience working with Unix/Linux systems from kernel to shell and beyond, with experience working with system libraries, file systems, and client-server protocols.
Networking: experience with network theory e.g. TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, etc., MAC addresses, IP packets, DNS, OSI layers, and load balancing.
Preferred qualifications:
Expertise in designing, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems.
In-depth knowledge of operating systems (processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they work).
Familiarity with algorithms, data structures and complexity analysis.
Systematic problem solving approach, coupled with a strong sense of ownership and drive.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!
But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

No one should die on the road just because some people are distracted while driving, or because they don't get timely help in the event of an accident.
Our solution is based on machine learning algorithms that can identify when a person is driving, when they are using their phone while driving, or when an accident occurs.
Besides learning from the best professionals, we provide the opportunity to attend conferences and professional development training. We have English classes and soft skill training as well.
The focus is on the willingness to do and on the efficiency as a team. Everyone should do what they do the best and what they love to do the best. Luckily these two things are very often the same.
We have Thirty Thursday every 2 weeks with quality beers, open bar and music. We have fun at table tennis matches in the office. In addition, we organize various community programs with colleagues from Boston. Every Thursday, we start the day with a team breakfast, with fresh pastries - including allergen-free ones.
Impact - azaz ""Make the world better through the work we do""
Simplicity - Semmit sem komplikálunk túl. ""Keep it simple""
Integrity - Minden nap, mindenben tisztán akarunk nyerni.
Humility - Nálunk nem az EGO van előtérben. Nyitottak vagyunk a másikra.
Excellence - Mindig ""challenge""-eljük a status quo-t. ""Leave everything better than you found it!""
Fun - jó hangulat, jó közösség.
Besides the 95 people in the Boston office, the Budapest team began to be assembled at the end of 2017. We are currently working together with 37 colleagues to achieve our goals - and are constantly expanding.
We combine Machine Learning with Data Science and Mobile Technology to provide a SaaS to our customers.
